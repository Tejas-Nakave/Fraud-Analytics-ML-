## **`Problem Statement`**
This project focuses on developing a fraud detection model using historical transaction data. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, making it a binary classification problem.

## **`Difficulties`**
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with approximately 97.14% of transactions labeled as non-fraudulent and 2.86% labeled as fraudulent.

## **`Top Performing Algorithm`**
XGBoost Classifier emerged as the top-performing algorithm, providing high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on both training and test sets.

## **`Methodology`**

Data Collection: 

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

Feature Engineering:

Model Selection and Training:

Model Evaluation:

Deployment and Prediction:

Insights Generation:

## **`Business Insights`**
Temporal Patterns: Transaction month is crucial for detecting fraudulent activity.
Behavioral Characteristics: Features like 'IsOldDevice' and 'webSessWebBrowser' offer insights into fraudster behavior.
Transaction Details: Attributes such as 'V6CF' and 'V3CF' play a critical role in fraud prediction.
